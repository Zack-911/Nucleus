# Kiko San Documentation

![Kiko San Logo](../../.gitbook/assets/KikoSan.png){:style="border-radius:30px;" height="128" width="128"}

Welcome to the documentation of **Kiko San**! Want to automate tasks or just explore a bot with a wide range of features? Kiko San will be there to enhance your time.

## Understanding How the Arguments Work

Before diving into this sea further, let’s get familiar with how arguments shown in the documentation work:

- `< >`: **Required arguments** – Think of these as the must-haves. If you forget to give the bot these, it'll throw a fit and refuse to work.
- `[ ]`: **Optional arguments** – These are like extras on a menu. You can choose to include them for a more customized experience, but the bot will still work just fine without them.
- `/`: **Choose One** – Pick your favorite from the available choices.

Didn't understand what was all that blabbering? Well, with an example right here, you'll understand a bit about what's actually happening.

```bash
k!command <oh i am required! / or maybe you want to choose me?> [well you can skip me if you want]
```
